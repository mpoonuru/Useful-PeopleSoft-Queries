Compare WebLib.Iscript grants between 2 Users 


Sometimes the easiest way to determine why one PeopleSoft user can't access a particular application feature is to compare
that user's authorizations to another user who can access that same feature. We can look for differences in Role Memberships,
Permission Lists inherited through roles, etc. Sometimes you have to dig deeper, into areas that most people find
inexplicable altogether, like WebLibraries and their constituent IScript functions. 
To that end, the following SQL will bare fruit.

Step1. Create a SQL View (PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR), which will return a list of authorized WebLib.IScripts for each user

SELECT DISTINCT A.ROLEUSER 
, C.MENUNAME 
, C.BARNAME 
, C.BARITEMNAME 
, C.PNLITEMNAME 
FROM PSROLEUSER A 
, PSROLECLASS B 
, PSAUTHITEM C 
WHERE A.ROLENAME = B.ROLENAME 
AND B.CLASSID = C.CLASSID 
AND C.MENUNAME LIKE 'WEBLIB%' 

Please note that each of the fields herein is a key field. 

Step2. Build the following query, preferably using PeopleSoft Query Manager 

SELECT A.MENUNAME 
, A.BARNAME 
, A.PNLITEMNAME 
, 'Y' 
, 'Y' 
, A.OPRID 
, '2' 
FROM PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR A 
WHERE A.OPRID = 1 
AND EXISTS (SELECT 'X' 
FROM PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR B 
WHERE B.MENUNAME = A.MENUNAME 
AND B.BARNAME = A.BARNAME 
AND B.BARITEMNAME = A.BARITEMNAME 
AND B.PNLITEMNAME = A.PNLITEMNAME 
AND B.OPRID = 2) 
UNION 
SELECT C.MENUNAME 
, C.BARNAME 
, C.PNLITEMNAME 
, 'Y' 
, 'N' 
, C.OPRID 
, '2' 
FROM PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR C 
WHERE C.OPRID = 1 
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'X' 
FROM PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR D 
WHERE D.OPRID = 2 
AND D.MENUNAME = C.MENUNAME 
AND D.BARNAME = C.BARNAME 
AND D.BARITEMNAME = C.BARITEMNAME 
AND D.PNLITEMNAME = C.PNLITEMNAME) 
UNION 
SELECT E.MENUNAME 
, E.BARNAME 
, E.PNLITEMNAME 
, 'N' 
, 'Y' 
, '1' 
, E.OPRID 
FROM PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR E 
WHERE E.OPRID = 2 
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 'X' 
FROM PS_AUTHWEBLIB_USR F 
WHERE F.OPRID = 1 
AND F.MENUNAME = E.MENUNAME 
AND F.BARNAME = E.BARNAME 
AND F.BARITEMNAME = E.BARITEMNAME 
AND F.PNLITEMNAME = E.PNLITEMNAME) 
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3

Please note, that the story does not end here. The listing produced by this query will give you a leg up (maybe),
on determining why one user can do something inside a PeopleSoft application while another user cannot.
If the feature enabled user does indeed have WebLib.Iscript grants missing from the other user, you will need to determine 
whether or not these additional grants are wholly or partially responsible for one user's success vs. the other's failure. 
If you are lucky enough to have something familiar jog your memory (Ex. User 1 is granted access to WEBLIB_SOAPTOCI and User 2 is not)
, therefore User 1 can use the ExcelToCi tool and User 2 cannot, congrats. On the other hand, the functionality 
granted by a specific WebLib.IScript may not be easily intuited by its name. In addition, User 1 andor User 2 may have grants 
to WebLib.IScripts that don't exist.
I plan to build an application engine program, which will facilitate identifying invalid authorizations of this type in the not too distant future.
